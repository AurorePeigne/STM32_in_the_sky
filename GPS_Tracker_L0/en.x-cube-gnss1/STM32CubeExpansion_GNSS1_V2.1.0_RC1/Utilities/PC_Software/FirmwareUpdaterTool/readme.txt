@par Tool Description 

	- FWUPG is a Java based graphical tool allowing the user to update the 
	firmware of the X-NUCLEO-GNSS1A1 expansion board connected with an STM32 
    Nucleo board.
	- FWUPG is platform independent and supports Windows, Mac OS X and Linux
    
@par Version 2.1.0

	- FWUPG allows the user to upgrade the X-NUCLEO-GNSS1A1 firmware to version 4.6.8.2
	
@par Hardware and Software environment

	- FWUPG requires JRE (Java Runtime) 6+
	- FWUPG uses jSerialComm (jSerialComm-2.0.2), a platform-independent serial port access library for Java (http://fazecast.github.io/jSerialComm/)
	- FWUPG requires a X-NUCLEO-GNSS1A1 expansion board connected with an STM32 NUCLEO-F401RE board which, in turn, is plugged to the PC via a USB cable
	- The Virtual_COM_Port application should run on the STM32 Nucleo board
	- The tool has been tested with NUCLEO-F401RE RevC

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
	- Windows/Mac: The tool can be launched by double-clicking the FWUPG.jar
	- Linux: Due to serial port access permission, the "user" should be added to "dialout" group before launching the tool.
	The tool can be launched by typing the following command line:
	$ java -jar FWUPG.jar	
	- The user should select the relevant serial port and then push the "Open" button.
		- NOTE: On Windows, the active serial port is typically the one highest numbered. 
	- The user can start the upgrading procedure by pushing the "Update FW >>>" button or using the "Tools" menu.
	- A progress bar shall inform the user about the upgrading status.
	- WARNING:
		- The user is not allowed to select an arbitrary firmware image browsing the file system, since
        only the latest firmware image is embedded in the deployable jar.
		- The user is strongly advised not to unplug the STM32 Nucleo board during the upgrading procedure.
